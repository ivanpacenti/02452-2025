    "In this exercise, we start by taking a closer look on some of the building blocks of machine learning and statistical modeling, namely **summary statistics** and **similarity measures**. While summary statistics capture key properties of data and help us understand and compare datasets, similarity metrics such as cosine similarity and norm-based distances are essential for certain machine learning methods, e.g. **$k$-nearest neighbors (kNN)** and **decision trees (DCTs)**. In the final parts of the exercise, we will do **supervised learning** with kNNs and DCTs on two real datasets.\n",
